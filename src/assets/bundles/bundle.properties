# New World - 1st Sector #
objective.mission.new-world01 = Welcome to Aeyama, soldier!
objective.mission.new-world02 = We just found this great planet recently.
objective.mission.new-world03 = A real paradise I tell you!
objective.mission.new-world04 = Anyway, you've been charged with the first scouting mission.
objective.mission.new-world05 = We're counting on you to find any useable stuff down there.
objective.mission.new-world06 = Start up by harvesting some wood\nover there, have a total of 150 wood.
objective.mission.new-world07 = Now research the Wood Harvester, so you can gather wood without looking.
objective.mission.new-world08 = Good! Now build some of those near the trees.
objective.mission.new-world09 = Now gather 50 more stone, because we're going to need a lot of that too.
objective.mission.new-world10 = Great, now research some basic stuff to get a small base going!
objective.mission.new-world11 = You're doing a great job so far, build some Stone Miner to really get us going.
objective.mission.new-world12 = Our scanners have detected a source of iron in the area,\nresearch what you need to mine it and get some.
objective.mission.new-world13 = Perfect! Go to the location on your map, build some miners and collect 50 raw iron.
objective.mission.new-world14 = Nice, everything going all good. Now go back to your core!
objective.mission.new-world15 = You'll need to research and build\nstockpiles right next to that Drop Pod of yours to increase\nyour resource capacity!
objective.mission.new-world16 = Here on Aeyama, you're going to need blueprints to research\nnew structures. To create blueprints, you'll need a\nResearch Station.
objective.mission.new-world17 = Now that your resource capacity has increased, research and\nbuild a Research Station.
objective.mission.new-world18 = Bring resources to your station and make your first blueprint.
objective.mission.new-world19 = Now, before you go deeper, you will need to research a Frontline Base.
objective.mission.new-world20 = I know it costs a lot, but now build it on top of your\nDrop Pod, it's a necessity, really.
objective.mission.new-world21 = Congratulations soldier! You did an amazing job to set up\nyour first outpost! Now keep scouting this great planet\nand keep up posted with any new info you get! Good Luck!

# Encounter - 2nd Sector #
objective.mission.encounter01 = Welcome soldier to your next location!
objective.mission.encounter02 = It's time to gather basic resources and explore the nearby area.
objective.mission.encounter03 = Great! Maybe it's time for you to get more advanced\nresources, let's get an Ore Smelter!
objective.mission.encounter04 = You'll need some heat to use the smelter, let's research and build\nthe Wood Dryer to get dry wood for the burner.
objective.mission.encounter05 = Perfect, now research and build the Burner next to the dry wood line!
objective.mission.encounter06 = Now that you have a running Burner, it's generating some heat\nthat can be used for the smelter.
objective.mission.encounter07 = It's finally time to research and build the Ore Smelter\nnext to the burner heat output.\nTwo burner give full efficiency to the smelter.
objective.mission.encounter08 = I will let you stock on some iron, it's a very useful material for building.
objective.mission.encounter09 = Now, why not explore this area more efficiently?\nIt's time for a Ground Scanner!
objective.mission.encounter10 = Go research and build the Ground Scanner, it will detect\nany lifeforms and some useful resources in the area!
objective.mission.encounter11 = Let's wait for the scanner do to it's work, it will\nprioritize the scanning of lifeforms for your security.
# Is there a way to get the timer current time? "{0}" didn't work.
objective.mission.encounter12 = It will take around 20 seconds to get the results.
objective.mission.encounter13 = It seems like it did detect unknown lifeforms... you should\nimmediately research and build defense.
objective.mission.encounter14 = You can research the Wood Walls, pretty basic, but we don't\nhave time for better, and then place them around your base to\nprotect your building and your core or else it's game over.
objective.mission.encounter15 = I hope you built a great wall and let some space because you'll\nneed to be able to fight back with turrets!
objective.mission.encounter16 = You'll need ammunition for the turrets to works, one take raw\nmaterial and the other takes shredded ammunition, that's\nwhere the Shredder do its job.
objective.mission.encounter17 = They didn't notice us... yet. Quickly research, build and set up\nthe turret, one might be enough, but I will not gamble my\nlife on it if I was you, I suggest multiple.
objective.mission.encounter18 = Oh! The Scanner seems to have found new resources, but they're\nclose to the enemy territory, you can see on your map where it's located.
objective.mission.encounter19 = I suggest that you upgrade and move your defense with you until\nyou get to the location, but be careful.
objective.mission.encounter20 = It seems to be Copper and Zinc, let's get some and refine them\nfor the future. You can reuse the smelter and select what\nshould be refined, only one type at a time is allowed.
objective.mission.encounter21 = Seems like the enemies didn't liked all the sound you made, they're\nmoving! I wish you goodluck, that's all for me, see you later!

objective.devNote = That's the end of this sector for now, it took a long time\nand we're sorry, it's probably not well explained, unbalanced, etc...\nbut we wait for your feedback on our [blue]Discord[white]\nto make it better. The next update will focus on content only,\nbalancing and some possible rework, so if you have any\nidea come tell us!
