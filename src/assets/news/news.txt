[white]A new ⁠#❗feedbacks❗ channel was created on [blue]Discord[white]! I ask you all to please take some time and write down your opinion about the old version of Aeyama, what you thought about it, what was good or bad and any improvements you can think of to make the rebirth version even better and greater. You are exceptionally allowed to talk in your native language, it will be translated.

[white]Hi @everyone, it's been 8 months, and no, it's not an update but it's time for Aeyama to finally [gold]comeback[white]...

[darkgray]Aeyama: The New World [white]will come back as a [gold]rebirth [white]version! Starting all over again from scratch but this time going slowly, not planning too much ahead to not lose motivation. The idea will stay the same but everything will be reworked.
The update might take some time to come but there will be [blue]beta [white]and [blue]pre-release [white]updates for you to try the future updates!
As of now, I'm in charge of everything but @FredyJabe is still there with us in the shadow, he might (or not) come back.
If you want to follow development, don't forget to check #⁠┃github (on Discord). As for me I'm in my exam period until July so development might be slow at the beginning. 

That's it for today, I'll see you next time or in the other text channels!
