[white]Hi everybody! The [yellow]v0.3 release [white]is out with the 2nd sector finally here! It might be a little unbalanced.

The next update (v0.4) is planned to be content focused, with a lot of new content and very needed balancing (it's time to give your suggestion on our [blue]Discord[white]!).

[yellow]* [white]Now only keeping the last 5 news messages, easier for client's bandwidth, and we don't need to keep living in the past ;P

If anyone wants to help out with translation, feel free to reach out of either Discord or GitHub!
We also need help from artists, if anyone's interested.
