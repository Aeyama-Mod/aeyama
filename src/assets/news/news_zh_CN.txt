[white]Hi everyone, after a long time, we finally decided to make a big decision for the mod...

[red]We will stop the campaign.

[yellow]Why?
[white]It's simple, we were not ready. Fredy was just making a mod for fun, then I joined not long after to have fun with someone else, and then suddenly... the mod blew up.
We weren't expecting that the mod would become this big so quickly and because of that we felt oppressed, forced and having way less liberty, even making this announcement was a long decision because we know this decision will not please anyone.
I burned out once when the v0.2 released, then I slowly came back and took Fredy's place as the main developer when he was fed up with Mindustry, and then I forced myself once again for the v0.3 where I almost burned out once again.

[yellow]When will it come back?
[white]Probably after the v1.0 official release, when content and progression will be completely reworked and stable. Then after the planet and the campaign will be focused until v2.0 official release, where the main planet will be done.

[yellow]What's the mod future?
[white]Simple, expanding the content which is currently small and new, making it better, more balanced and enjoyable for everyone.
Since the mod migrated to Java, I became the main developer and have since total control (Fredy's still in the shadow), but there's a very important thing missing... feedbacks.
Feedback, even for small things, are really important for us, we can't know what's the problem when you don't tell us, that's also why I started making polls to "force" you to give your opinion, making the beta version to give easy access to the latest change and being able to fix problem before the official release.

 

It was hard to make this decision but we finally did it, I hope that the mod content and community keep expanding (slowly please) and that Fredy will get back soon. That's all for now, see you all next time!

[white]A small update was released, the [yellow]v0.3.1 [white]which has some small changes, mainly translation and balancing.
    
As of today, beta release will be made, only if enough content is added, every week or two on Monday! Basically you now have the stable release, the beta release every 1 or 2 weeks and the dev version, available on each commits via GitHub Actions!

Like usual report bugs on the GitHub repository Issue and come on our [blue]Discord [white]to get help or give your idea!

[white]大家好，在 [yellow]v0.3 发布 [white]第二地区终于来了，但可能有点不平衡

在下一次更新 (v0.4)计划以内容为中心，有很多新内容和非常需要平衡（是时候在我们的 [blue]Discord[white]提出建议了！). 

[red]更新: [white]似乎玩家在某一时刻缺少了目标(在您获得铜和锌之前)，你必须亲自为些泡他的和防御才能生存。这似乎有点难，我们做了一些平衡

[red]UPDATE: [white]It seems like player are missing some objectives, at one point (before it ask you to get copper and zinc) you have to build walls and turrets to be able to survive! It seems like this sector was too hard and some balancing was made.

[white]大家好，mod将会有一个大新闻！ 我们现在是一个 [red]Java [white]mod！ 您可以通过 mod 浏览器重新下载 mod 来更新它，发布版可能很快就会发布，不过还有一些事情要完成。

不过再那之前，cya。
