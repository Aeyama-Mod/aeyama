[white]Hi everybody! The [yellow]v0.3 release [white]is out with the 2nd sector finally here! It might be a little unbalanced.

The next update (v0.4) is planned to be content focused, with a lot of new content and very needed balancing (it's time to give your suggestion on our [blue]Discord[white]!).

[red]UPDATE: [white]It seems like player are missing some objectives, at one point (before it ask you to get copper and zinc) you have to build walls and turrets to be able to survive! It seems like this sector was too hard and some balancing was made.

If you have any issue or feedback come on our [blue]Discord [white]or create an issue on GitHub! Adiós!
