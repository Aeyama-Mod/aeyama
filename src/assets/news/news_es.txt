[white]A small update was released, the [yellow]v0.3.1 [white]which has some small changes, mainly translation and balancing.

As of today, beta release will be made, only if enough content is added, every week or two on Monday! Basically you now have the stable release, the beta release every 1 or 2 weeks and the dev version, available on each commits via GitHub Actions!

Like usual report bugs on the GitHub repository Issue and come on our [blue]Discord [white]to get help or give your idea!

[white]Hi everybody! The [yellow]v0.3 release [white]is out with the 2nd sector finally here! It might be a little unbalanced.

The next update (v0.4) is planned to be content focused, with a lot of new content and very needed balancing (it's time to give your suggestion on our [blue]Discord[white]!).

[red]UPDATE: [white]It seems like player are missing some objectives, at one point (before it ask you to get copper and zinc) you have to build walls and turrets to be able to survive! It seems like this sector was too hard and some balancing was made.

[white]Holà! The [yellow]first sector [white]was [green]updated[white]! The objectives are all back.

If you have any issue or feedback come on our [blue]Discord [white]or create an issue on GitHub! Adiós!
