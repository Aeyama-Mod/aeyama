**The campaign is no longer developed as of August 7th, 2023.**<br><br>

With ground-based gameplay and focusing on your character development instead of army management, experience a whole new type of gameplay on a newly discovered world on which you've been tasked to explore. Using the new planet resources you'll have to rediscover the technologies of the past to survive and deal with whatever this place throws at you.
